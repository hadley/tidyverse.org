```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(stringr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

We are happy to announce that [stringr](http://stringr.tidyverse.org/) 1.3.0
is now on CRAN. stringr provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make
working with strings as easy as possible. For a complete list of changes, please
see the [release notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr/releases/tag/v1.3.0).

## What's new?

*  Two new wrappers from the [glue](http://glue.tidyverse.org/)
package: `str_glue()` and `str_glue_data()`. If you haven't heard of glue, you're in for a treat! Glue lets you easily interpolate data into strings.

    ```{r gluex}
    name <- "Chet Manley"
    str_glue("My name is {name}.")
    ```
    Since stringr is loaded with tidyverse, this means that you can now access glue's functionality without loading     another package.

*  `str_flatten()`, a wrapper for the `stri_flatten()` function, which 
flattens a character vector into a single string. This is equivalent to `paste(x, collapse = "-")` but it is a bit more explicit in your code -- `str_flatten()` always returns a single string.

*  `str_remove()` and `str_remove_all()`, which wrap `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` for removing patterns from strings.

*  `str_squish()`, which removes whitespace from the left and right sides of strings, and converts multiple spaces or space-like characters from the middle of strings into a single space.

    ```{r spacejam}
    str_squish("\n\nString \t\nwith all \tthis     \rspace   in it.\n\n")
    ```

## API changes

The long deprecated `str_join()`, `ignore.case()`, and `perl()` functions
have been removed. You may see `Error : object ‘ignore.case’ is not exported by 'namespace:stringr'` during package build.
