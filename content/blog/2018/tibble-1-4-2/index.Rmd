```

We’re excited to announce version 1.4.2 of the *tibble* package, a minor update focusing mostly on display and performance.  This is a small release designed to address the biggest issues introduced in [version 1.4.1](tibble-1-4-1). We've introduced a number of option to give you greater control over the appearance, and tweaked the default to work better for more people. (The option names start with `pillar`, because that's the package that is actually responsible for printing; the new options are available with *pillar* 1.1.0 which will be installed automatically when you install or upgrade *tibble*.)
In addition, tibbles are now displayed faster, even very wide ones. The subsetting performance has also improved.

There are some other small improvements and bug fixes: please see the [release notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/releases/tag/v1.4.2) for a complete list.  Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues) to submit bugs or suggest ideas, your contributions are always welcome.

## New options

This article shows the effect of each new option based on the following simple tibble.

The following options were added:

- `pillar.bold`: Use bold font, e.g. for column headers? This currently defaults to `FALSE`, because many terminal fonts have poor support for bold fonts. If the bold-faced column names in tibble 1.4.1 worked for you, add `options(pillar.bold = TRUE)` to your `.Rprofile`.

- `pillar.subtle`: Use subtle style, e.g. for insignificant digits? Default: `TRUE`, see below for the effects of `options(pillar.subtle = FALSE)`.

- `pillar.neg`: Highlight negative numbers? Default: `TRUE`, the output for `options(pillar.neg = FALSE)` is shown below.

- `pillar.sigfig`: The number of significant digits that will be printed and
    highlighted, default: 3.  (Set the `pillar.subtle` option to `FALSE` to
    turn off highlighting of significant digits.)  See below for an example with
    `options(pillar.sigfig = 5)`:

- `pillar.min_title_chars`: The minimum number of characters for the column
    title, default: `15`.  Column titles may be truncated up to that width to
    save horizontal space. Set to `Inf` to turn off truncation of column
    titles.  In our example, a column hidden previously is shown when reducing
    `pillar.min_title_chars` to 10:
