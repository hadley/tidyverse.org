```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE
)
knitr::opts_knit$set(
  root.dir = system.file(package = "fs"))
library(fs)
```

[fs 1.0.0][fs] is now available on CRAN!
[fs] provides a cross-platform, uniform interface to file system operations.
[fs] uses [libuv](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/fs.html) under the hood, which
gives a rock solid cross-platform interface to the filesystem.


Install the latest version with:
``` r
install.packages("fs")
```

### Comparison vs base equivalents

**fs** functions smooth over some of the idiosyncrasies of file handling with
base R functions:

* Vectorization. All **fs** functions are vectorized, accepting multiple paths
  as input. Base functions are inconsistently vectorized.

* Predictable return values that always convey a path. All **fs** functions
  return a character vector of paths, a named integer or a logical vector, where
  the names give the paths. Base return values are more varied: they are often
  logical or contain error codes which require downstream processing.

* Explicit failure. If **fs** operations fail, they throw an error. Base
  functions tend to generate a warning and a system dependent error code. This
  makes it easy to miss a failure.

* UTF-8 all the things! **fs** functions always convert input paths to UTF-8 and
  return results as UTF-8. This gives you path encoding consistency across OSes.
  Base functions rely on the native system encoding.

* Naming convention. **fs** functions use a consistent naming convention.
  Because base R's functions were gradually added over time there are a number
  of different conventions used (e.g. `path.expand()` vs `normalizePath()`;
  `Sys.chmod()` vs `file.access()`).

### Tidy paths

**fs** functions always return 'tidy' paths. Tidy paths

  - always expand `~`
  - use `/` to delimit directories
  - never have multiple `/` or trailing `/`

Tidy paths are also coloured (if your terminal supports it) based on the
file permissions and file type. This colouring can be customised or extended by
setting the `LS_COLORS` environment variable, in the same output format as [GNU
dircolors](http://www.bigsoft.co.uk/blog/index.php/2008/04/11/configuring-ls_colors).

### Usage

**fs** functions are divided into four main categories:

  * `path_` for manipulating paths
  * `file_` for files
  * `dir_` for directories
  * `link_` for links

Directories and links are special types of files, so `file_` functions
will generally also work when applied to a directory or link.

```{r}
library(fs)

# list files in the current directory
dir_ls()

# create a new directory
tmp <- dir_create(file_temp())
tmp

# create new files in that directory
file_create(path(tmp, "my-file.txt"))
dir_ls(tmp)

# remove files from the directory
file_delete(path(tmp, "my-file.txt"))
dir_ls(tmp)

# remove the directory
dir_delete(tmp)
```

**fs** is designed to work well with the pipe, though because it is a
minimal-dependency infrastructure package it doesn't provide the pipe itself.
You will need to attach [magrittr](http://magrittr.tidyverse.org) or similar.

```{r}
library(magrittr)

paths <- file_temp() %>%
  dir_create() %>%
  path(letters[1:5]) %>%
  file_create()
paths

paths %>% file_delete()
```

**fs** functions also work well in conjunction with other
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages, like
[dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org).

Some examples...

```{r}
suppressMessages(
  library(tidyverse))
```

Filter files by type, permission, size and 15 other attributes.

```{r}
dir_info(recursive = TRUE) %>%
  filter(type == "file", permissions == "u+r", size > "10KB") %>%
  arrange(desc(size)) %>%
  select(path, permissions, size, modification_time)
```

Tabulate and display folder size.

```{r}
dir_info(recursive = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(directory = path_dir(path)) %>%
  tally(wt = size, sort = TRUE)
```

Read a collection of files into one data frame.

`dir_ls()` returns a named vector, so it can be used directly with
`purrr::map_df(.id)`.

```{r}
# Create separate files for each species
iris %>%
  split(.$Species) %>%
  map(select, -Species) %>%
  iwalk(~ write_tsv(.x, paste0(.y, ".tsv")))

# Show the files
iris_files <- dir_ls(glob = "*.tsv")
iris_files

# Read the data into a single table, including the filenames
iris_files %>%
  map_df(read_tsv, .id = "file", col_types = cols(), n_max = 2)

file_delete(iris_files)
```

### Feedback wanted!

We hope **fs** is a useful tool for both analysis scripts and packages.
Please open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/r-lib/fs) for any feature requests or bugs.

In particular, we have found non-ASCII filenames in non-English locales on
Windows to be especially tricky to reproduce and handle correctly. There is
already [one
fix](https://github.com/r-lib/fs/commit/b0b7a88de708300fd48273b0824e9bb265a0ee7b)
for this issue since **fs** was submitted to CRAN. Additional Feedback from
users is greatly appreciated!
