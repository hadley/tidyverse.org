```

[dplyr 1.0.0 is coming soon](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/dplyr-1-0-0-is-coming-soon/), and last week we showed how [`summarise()` is growing](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/dplyr-1-0-0-summarise/). Today, I wanted to talk a little bit about functions for selecting, renaming, and relocating columns.

If you're interested in trying out the features you see in this blog post, you'll need the development version of dplyr. You can install it with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr")
```

Note that the development version won't become 1.0.0 until it's released, but it has all the same features.

```{r, setup}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

## Select and renaming

`select()` and `rename()` are now significantly more flexible thanks to enhancements to the [tidyselect](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/) package. There are now five ways to select variables in `select()` and `rename()`:

* By **position**: `df %>% select(1, 5, 10)` or `df %>% select(1:4)`.
  Selecting by position is not generally recommended, but `rename()`ing
  by position can be very useful, particularly if the variable names are 
  very long, non-syntactic, or duplicated.
 
* By **name**: `df %>% select(a, e, j)`, `df %>% select(c(a, e, j))` or 
  `df %>% select(a:d)`.

* By **function of name**: `df %>% select(starts_with("x"))`, or
  `df %>% select(ends_with("s"))`. You can also use helpers `contains()`
  and `matches()` for more flexibly matching.

* By **type**: `df %>% select(is.numeric)`, `df %>% select(is.factor)`.

* By **any combination** of the above using the Boolean operators `!`, `&`, and `|`:

    * `df %>% select(!is.factor)`: selects all non-factor variables.
    
    * `df %>% select(is.numeric & starts_with("x"))`: selects all
      numeric variables that starts with "x".
      
    * `df %>% select(starts_with("a") | ends_with("z"))`: selects all
      variables that starts with "a" or ends with "z".

(We owe a debt of gratitude to [Irene Steves](http://irene.rbind.io/), who put together a [detailed analysis](https://gist.github.com/isteves/afb7ac5a3b185f600d7f130d99142174) showing the challenges of the previous approach, and motivating us to do better.)

Here's a few examples of how you might use these techniques in with some toy data:

```{r}
# Rename by position to fix a data frame with duplicated column names
df1 <- tibble(a = 1:5, a = 5:1, .name_repair = "minimal")
df1
df1 %>% rename(b = 2)

df2 <- tibble(x1 = 1, x2 = "a", x3 = 2, y1 = "b", y2 = 3, y3 = "c", y4 = 4)
# Keep numeric columns
df2 %>% select(is.numeric)

# Or all columns that aren't character
df2 %>% select(!is.character)

# Or columns that start with x and are numeric
df2 %>% select(starts_with("x") & is.numeric)
```

## Programming

We've also made `select()` and `rename()` a little easier to program with when you have a character vector of variable names, thanks to the new `any_of()` and `all_of()` functions. They both take a character vector of variable names:

```{r}
vars <- c("x1", "x2", "y1", "z")
df2 %>% select(any_of(vars))
```
`any_of()` supersedes the poorly named `one_of()` function; I have no idea why I called it `one_of()` because it's always selected multiple variables!

They differ only in what happens when variables are not present in the data frame. Where `any_of()` silently ignores the missing columns, `all_of()` throws an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
df2 %>% select(all_of(vars))
```

You can learn more about programming with tidy selection in [`?dplyr_tidy_select`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html). 

## Renaming programatically

The new `rename_with()` makes it easier to rename variables programmatically:

```{r}
df2 %>% rename_with(toupper)
```
(This pairs well with functions like [`janitor::make_clean_names()`](http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/reference/make_clean_names.html).)

You can optionally choose which columns to apply the transformation to:

```{r}
df2 %>% rename_with(toupper, starts_with("x"))

df2 %>% rename_with(toupper, is.numeric)
```
`rename_with()` supersedes `rename_if()` and `rename_at()`; we'll talk more about the other `_if()`, `_at()`, and `_all()` functions in the near future.

## `relocate()`

For a long time, people have asked an easy way to change the order of columns in data frame. It's always been possible to perform some transformations with `select()`, but it only worked for simple moves, and felt a bit hacky. dplyr now has a specialised function for moving columns around: `relocate()`. The most common need is to move variables to the front, so that's the default behaviour:

```{r}
df3 <- tibble(w = 0, x = 1, y = "a", z = "b")
df3 %>% relocate(y, z)
df3 %>% relocate(is.character)
```

(It uses the same syntax as `select()` and `rename()` so you can use arbitrarily complex expressions to pick which variables you want to move.)

If you want to move columns to a different position use `.before` or `.after`:

```{r}
df3 %>% relocate(w, .after = y)
df3 %>% relocate(w, .before = y)

# If you want to move columns to the right hand side use `last_col()`
df3 %>% relocate(w, .after = last_col())
```

## Column functions

Together these three functions form a family of functions for working with columns:

* `select()` changes membership.
* `rename()` or `rename_with()` to changes names.
* `relocate()` to changes position.

It's interesting to think about how these compare to their row-based equivalents:
`select()` is analogous to `filter()`, and `relocate()` to `arrange()`. There there's no row-wise equivalent to `rename()` because in the tidyverse rows don't have names.
