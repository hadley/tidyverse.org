We're thrilled to announce the release of [`tidymodels.org`](https://www.tidymodels.org)! The site is meant to be a central location for learning about the tidymodels packages. The site is a new take on a familiar look:

This site has a different organization than its tidyverse sibling. 

The [_Getting Started_ landing site](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) has a series of five articles that are aimed at readers who have little to no experience with the tidymodels packages. Each article focuses on a specific task (e.g. building a model). The last article shows a small case study that brings all of the other elements together. 

We will be consolidating many of the articles on the individual `pkgdown` sites to the [_Learn_](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/) page. The idea is that previous articles that involve any real data analysis should be found on `tidymodels.org`. The feedback that we've received was that keeping the articles in the individual sites made it too difficult to find the right material (especially when an article used multiple packages). Articles describing specific technical details of the package will remain in the pkgdown sites. New articles will be added to the _Learn_ section based on new functions or for specific topics that need more documentation (based GitHub issues as well as posts to StackOverflow or RStudio Community). 

The [`Help`](https://www.tidymodels.org/help/) section is an excellent place to consult when you are stuck on a problem or when you want to know more. There are additional links to books using the tidymodels packages as well as tools to search across [all tidymodels functions](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/), [`parsnip` model functions](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/), and [`recipe` steps](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/recipes/). 

Blog posts related to tidymodels will still be posted here at the [tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/).

`tidymodels.org`  would not be possible without Alison Hill, whose incredible expertise and tenacity made it happen. Additionally, Alison and Julia Silge did an amazing job making the existing content more readable and better organized. Desir√©e De Leon worked her magic to make the site look even better. The tidyverse group and Joshua Spiewak were also very supportive and helpful.
