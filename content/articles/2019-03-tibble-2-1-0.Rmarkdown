Version 2.1.0 of the *tibble* package is on CRAN now. Tibbles are a modern reimagining of the data frame, keeping what time has shown to be effective, and throwing out what is not, with nicer default output too! Grab the latest version with:

```r
install.packages("tibble")
```

This release mostly focuses on the name repair introduced in *tibble* 2.0.1.
Too late we realized that the implementation doesn't provide satisfactory results in an important setting: unique names for a tibble with empty column names.

The initial implementation would turn these names into two dots and a number.
These have a special meaning: they are reserved words, you can assign them a value but not query them.

```{r assign-dot-dot, error = TRUE}
..2 <- 5
..2
```

The ability to query a value by name is very important in the tidy evaluation framework.
Breaking this in a very common setting would cause pain to many users.
That's why we now add yet another dot in this case.

```{r repair}
names(as_tibble(list(1, 2, 3), .name_repair = "unique"))
```

For consistency, three dots are used for all disambiguating suffixes, not only for empty names.
This might affect you if you use *readxl* or another package that uses the new name repair, and we're sorry for the disruption.
We're confident that a bit of short-term pain now is better than the agony that would have come from the existent behavior.
Also, name repair currently is in the "maturing" lifecycle,
