## Which versions of R do tidyverse packages support? 

Though package-specific minimum versions of R are given in the `Depends` fields of individual `DESCRIPTION` files, our general policy is to support the __current version__, the __devel version__, and __four previous versions__ of R.

With the [prerelease of R version 3.6.0 (Planting of a Tree)](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base-prerelease/) already available, and its final release slated for 2019-04-26, you can expect tidyverse packages to drop support for R 3.1 in the coming weeks. This aligns R version support in the tidyverse with [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which as of the latest release requires R 3.2.3 (due to an update to the [highr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=highr) package).
