We had our second official [tidyverse developer
day](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/04/tidyverse-dev-day-at-user-2019/)
prior to [useR! 2019](http://www.user2019.fr/) in Toulouse. The lessons learned
from our [inaugural dev
day](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/11/tidyverse-developer-day-2019/)
helped make this one an even more successful, with around **40** pull
requests merged by the end of the day (and [more than
**65**](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22tidy-dev-day+%3Anerd_face%3A%22+created%3A%3E2019-07-07+is%3Amerged&type=Issues)
to-date). More importantly, based on the feedback we got, people had a really good
time!

### Improvements

  - ü§ù **Helpers** Among the \~70 participants were 20
    helpers, identifiable by special, snazzy nametags. The goal of tidy dev day
    is to include everyone regardless of their level of experience. But getting
    those people in the same room isn't enough, and asking for help can be
    intimidating. Having friendly faces circulating and ready to lend a hand
    made the event much warmer for newcomers (and helping others is pretty darn
    satisfying, too).
  
  - üè∑ **Post-its** Browsing tagged GitHub issues can be a
    challenge unto itself, and with a room full of people doing this
    simultaneously, you can quickly end up with multiple people (or groups)
    unwittingly working on the same task. So, we went back to the basics:
    colour-coded sticky notes with issues printed on them. This also made for a
    pleasing visual as colourful squares migrated from `To Do` to `Done`.
  
  - üõé **The gong** Getting your PR merged is a cause for
    celebration, and Hadley likes to travel with a gong. Thus, it seems only
    natural that we combine these two truths by punctuating PR merges with the ringing of
    a gong.

### What's next?

We will be hosting our next tidyverse dev day on **January 31st** in San
Francisco, following [rstudio::conf(2020)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/).
We haven't yet finalized a venue, but it will be convenient for people who‚Äôve
chosen lodging based on the rstudio::conf location. Once we've worked out the
details, we'll open ticket sales ($10 to be donated to a local non-profit).

If you're considering joining us, we encourage you to check out some of the blog
posts from this past round's attendees. [Laura
Acion](https://lacion.rbind.io/post/my-first-user/) and [Dragos
Moldovan-Gr√ºnfeld](https://www.mango-solutions.com/blog/user2019-roundup-workflow-reproducibility-and-friends)
both wrote about their experiences, and we'll happily add links to posts we
missed (see the GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/issues/330)).

A huge __thank you__ goes out to everyone who attended, especially the helpers! üôè
