  Since the initial CRAN submission almost two years ago, many bugs were fixed
  and new features added, including alignment detection, improved handling of 
  `{{` and `tryCatch()` expressions and more.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>", 
  fig.width = 7, 
  fig.align = 'center',
  fig.asp = 0.618, # 1 / phi
  out.width = "700px", 
  eval = FALSE
)
```

The initial version of styler was released on CRAN in December 2017. Since then,
five new versions were released and styler was improved substantially, but many
improvements were related to special cases or even edge cases. These are all
contained in the [change log](https://styler.r-lib.org/news/index.html). Here,
we want to focus on a few changes up to version 1.2.0 that we believe are the 
most relevant. You can install the latest stable version from CRAN with
`install.packages("styler")`.

# Alignment detection

styler can finally detect aligned code and keep it aligned! For example, the 
following code won't be modified by styler:

```{r}
call(
  some_arg = 123,
  more     = "x"
)
```

Although quite intuitive, you may need to tweak your aligned code a bit to match
styler's definition of aligned code. Otherwise, the code will get reformatted
anyway. Check out the
[vignette](https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/detect-alignment.html) that
describes the conditions in both technical and non-technical terms. Note that it
currently only works for *function calls*, so styler will not treat the below as
aligned

```{r}
x  <- 2
x2 <- f(x)

```

and turn it into

```{r}
x <- 2
x2 <- f(x)

```

unless you also use `strict = FALSE`.^[E.g. `styler::style_text(..., strict =
FALSE)`, but note that this has also other effects on styling that you might not
want.]

# rlang's {{

In [rlang 0.4.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/06/rlang-0-4-0/) a new
interpolation operator was introduced: `{{` (read curly curly). Because `styler
< 1.2.0` understood these as regular curly braces, you ended up with

```{r}
call({
  {
    x
  }
})
```

when styling `call({{x}})`, which is non-sense. Now styler yields `call({{ x
}})`.

# Addins

The *Style active file* Addin now remembers the cursor position and the details
of styling can be specified. For example, if you always only want to style
spaces with the Addin, put this in your `.Rprofile`:^[E.g. via
`usethis::usethis::edit_r_profile()`, making sure you use the right value for
the `scope` argument]

```{r}
options(
  styler.addins_style_transformer = "styler::tidyverse_style(scope = 'spaces')"
)
```

You can also set the value of this option interactively with the *set style*
Addin (not persistent over sessions). For details, see `help("styler_addins")`.

The customization of the styling does not affect the command-line API
(`styler::style_text()` and friends). We are not sure how users could best
customize styling, but you can track progress on that in
[r-lib/styler#319](https://github.com/r-lib/styler/issues/319).

Remember that you can also set the environment variable `save_after_styling` to
`TRUE` if you are tired of saving the file after styling it with the Addin.

# Braces in function calls

`tryCatch()` expressions often look like this:

```{r}
tryCatch(
  {
    exp(x)
  },
  error = function(x) x
)
```

Prior to version 1.2.0, styler would return this odd formatting:

```{r}
tryCatch({
  exp(x)
},
error = function(x) x
)
```

Now, the line is broken before the opening curly brace in function calls, except
if there is only one brace expression and it's the last in the function call.
The typical use case is `testthat::test_that(...)`, i.e. the following code
won't be modified:

```{r}
test_that("some condition holds", {
  some_code()
})
```

# Other changes

Some other changes are:

* styler depends on tibble >= 1.4.2 and runs 2x as fast as initially.

* styler can style roxygen code examples in the source code of
  packages.

* styler can style `.Rnw` files.

* The print method for the output of `style_text()` returns
  syntax-highlighted code by default, controllable via the option
  `styler.colored_print.vertical`.

# Adaption of styler

We'd like to highlight that styler integrates with various other tools you might
be using:

- As a git pre-commit hook. Two standard calls from the R console, and you are
  all set. We are convinced that this is the preferred way of using styler to
  ensure all your files are consistently formatted. Check out the [online
  documentation](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/) of the R package
  `precommit` that also implements many other useful hooks.

- `usethis::use_tidy_style()` styles your project according to the tidyverse
  style guide.

- `knitr::knitr()` and friends recognize the R code chunk option `tidy =
  "styler"` for `.Rnw` and `.Rmd` files to pretty-print code.

- `reprex::reprex(..., style = TRUE)` to prettify reprex code before printing.
  To permanently use `style = TRUE` without specifying it every time, you can
  add the following line to your `.Rprofile` (e.g. via
  `usethis::edit_r_profile()`): `options(reprex.styler = TRUE)`.

- There are plugins for
  [Emacs](https://github.com/lassik/emacs-format-all-the-code) and
  [VIM](https://github.com/w0rp/ale/pull/2401#issuecomment-485942966).

# Outlook

We have some cool new features in the pipeline such as
[cachging](https://github.com/r-lib/styler/pull/538) for faster styling or 
[make styler ignoring some lines](https://github.com/r-lib/styler/pull/560), 
which you can try out installing from the respective branches. We want to thank 
all contributors for their support over the last two years.
