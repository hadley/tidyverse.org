We're pleased to announce that [haven 2.0.0](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) is now on CRAN. haven enables R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical packages by wrapping the [ReadStat](https://github.com/WizardMac/ReadStat) C library written by [Evan Miller](http://www.evanmiller.org/). As always, you can find a detailed account of all the changes in this release in the [Changelog](https://haven.tidyverse.org/news/index.html#haven-2-0-0).

## Breaking changes

The biggest change is that [`labelled()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled.html) and [`labelled_spss()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled_spss.html) now produce objects with class "haven_labelled" and "haven_labelled_spss". This resolves a [problematic clash](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven/issues/329) with the labelled class defined by [Frank Harrell](http://www.fharrell.com/)'s [Hmisc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html) package. 

Given Hmisc has been around much longer than haven (Hmisc's oldest source [archive on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Hmisc/) is from 2003), it makes sense that haven should be the one to make the change. This will require some changes to packages that use haven, but shouldnâ€™t affect user code.

```{r}
x1 <- haven::labelled(c(1, 1, 2), c(Grunt = 1, Sgt = 2),
                      label = "Army status")

class(x1)
```

```{r}
x2 <- haven::labelled_spss(1:10, c(Good = 1, Bad = 8), na_range = c(9, Inf),
                           label = "Quality rating")

class(x2)
```

## Minor improvements

`labelled()` and `labelled_spss()` now support adding the label attribute to the resulting object (as seen in the code above). The label is a short, human-readable description of the object, and is now also used when printing, and can be easily removed using the new [`zap_label()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/zap_label.html) function.

```{r}
x1

zap_labels(x1)
```
