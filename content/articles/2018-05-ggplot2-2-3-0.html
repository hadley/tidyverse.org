<p>A new release of ggplot2 (2.3.0) is on the horizon, and we’d love to have people
try it out, give us feedback, and <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues">report issues</a>
before we submit it to CRAN. This version is the culmination of over a year and
a half of development, not all of which will be captured here. So, please see <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/NEWS.md">NEWS</a> for a fuller
account of updates and changes.</p>
<p>In addition to highlighting a few features and improvements, we also want to
share a bit about our release-preparation process for ggplot2, which has over
2,000 reverse dependencies.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;tidyverse/ggplot2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If needed, you can restore the release version by installing from CRAN:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)</code></pre>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<div id="our-process" class="section level3">
<h3>Our process</h3>
<p>Regression testing, visual and otherwise, allows us to keep track of changes
throughout the development process. Before submitting an update to CRAN,
we need to ensure that the packages that depend on ours still pass <code>R CMD check</code>, and inform reverse-dependency maintainers in the event that they do not.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
We use <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck">revdepcheck</a> to help automate this
process, and distinguish between “false positives” (pre-existing failures), and
issues introduced in the development version of your package.</p>
<p>At this point, we begin to manually examine the failures. “Newly broken” issues
are extracted from the problems report and put into a Google sheet where (with
the great help of Thomas Lin Pedersen, Claus Wilke, and Kara Woo) we identified
clusters of errors to tackle. For example, 97 packages returned a warning due
to a namespace clash between <code>dplyr::vars()</code> and <code>ggplot2::vars()</code>. That’s
something we clearly need to fix, so we open an <a href="https://github.com/%20tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2585">issue</a> to track progress.</p>
<p>Where reverse-dependency errors result from a deliberate design change, we
collect “symptomatic” error messages, and (hopefully) fixes to offer the
maintainers of affected packages. These go in the “Breaking changes” section of
the NEWS file, so that if you encounter a new error you can easily search for
the error message and find the resolution. Because ggplot2 is an old and much
used package, we try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. However, sometimes
we deem it important to make a change that break existing code. Typically this
is for one of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We discover that code that previously appeared to work was actually hiding a
potential error. For example, in this version of ggplot2 we ensure that input
data frames don’t have duplicate column names. Previously ggplot2 just took the
first column with a name, which might have concealed a bug.</p></li>
<li><p>We decided that it’s worth breaking a small amount of existing code in the
interests of improving future code. For example, this version of ggplot2 adds
support for <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/NEWS.md#tidy-evaluation">tidy evaluation</a>
making ggplot2 more compatible with the rest of the tidyverse. This breaks a
small number of packages that use ggplot2 but should affect very little data
analysis code, so we decided that it was worth it.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="what-to-do-if-you-run-into-a-breaking-change" class="section level3">
<h3>What to do if you run into a breaking change</h3>
<p>If you run into an error when running code that works with ggplot2
2.2.1 (the version on CRAN as of this writing), you should look for it in the
<a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/NEWS.md#breaking-changes">“Breaking changes”</a>
section of news. If you <em>can’t</em> find it in the news, please file an issue -
either it’s an inadvertent change, or we need to describe it better in the news
(or make it easier to find when searching for keywords). As per usual, please
do a search of <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues">existing issues</a>
before filing a new one to avoid duplication.</p>
<p>You can also ask for help in <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">community.rstudio.com</a>.</p>

<div id="new-features" class="section level2">
<h2>New features</h2>
<div id="tidy-evaluation" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidy evaluation</h3>
<p>You can now use quasiquotation in <code>aes()</code>, <code>facet_wrap()</code>, and <code>facet_grid()</code>.
To support quasiquotation in facetting we’ve added a new helper that works
similarly to <code>aes()</code>: <code>vars()</code>, short for variables, and instead of
<code>facet_grid(x + y ~ a + b)</code> you can now write <code>facet_grid(vars(x, y), vars(a, b))</code>.
The formula interface won’t go away; but the new <code>vars()</code> interface should be
much easier to program with.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x_var &lt;- quo(wt)
y_var &lt;- quo(mpg)
group_var &lt;- quo(cyl)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(!!x_var, !!y_var)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(!!group_var))</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="sf" class="section level3">
<h3>sf</h3>
<p>ggplot2 now has full support for simple features through
<a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/">sf</a> using <code>geom_sf()</code> and <code>coord_sf()</code>; it now
automatically aligns CRS across layers, sets up the correct aspect ratio, and
draws a graticule.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nc &lt;- sf::st_read(system.file(&quot;shape/nc.shp&quot;, package = &quot;sf&quot;))
#&gt; Reading layer `nc&#39; from data source `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library/sf/shape/nc.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39;

</div>
<div id="calculated-aesthetics" class="section level3">
<h3>Calculated aesthetics</h3>
<p>The new <code>stat()</code> function offers a cleaner, and better-documented syntax for
calculated-aesthetic variables. This replaces the older approach of surrounding
the variable name with <code>...</code>. Instead of using <code>aes(y = ..count..)</code>, you can use
<code>aes(y = stat(count))</code>.</p>
<p>This is particularly nice for more complex calculations, as <code>stat()</code> only needs
to be specified once; e.g. <code>aes(y = stat(count / max(count)))</code> rather than
<code>aes(y = ..count.. / max(..count..))</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="viridis" class="section level3">
<h3>Viridis</h3>
<p>Several new functions have been added to make it easy to use Viridis colour
scales: <code>scale_colour_viridis_c()</code> and <code>scale_fill_viridis_c()</code> for continuous,
and <code>scale_colour_viridis_d()</code> and <code>scale_fill_viridis_d()</code> for discrete.
Viridis is also now used as the default colour and fill scale for ordered
factors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="and-more" class="section level2">
<h2>And more…</h2>
<p>There are several other improvements, which will be described in further detail
once the ggplot 2.3.0 is released on CRAN (currently targeted for June 25th).
For now, please kick the tires and let us know what you think!</p>
