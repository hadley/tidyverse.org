Version 2.1.0 of the *tibble* package is on CRAN now. Tibbles are a modern reimagining of the data frame, keeping what time has shown to be effective, and throwing out what is not, with nicer default output too! Grab the latest version with:

```r
install.packages("tibble")
```

This release mostly focuses on the name repair introduced in *tibble* 2.0.1.
We have specific regrets about one aspect of name repair and we think the pros of fixing it outweigh the cons.
When a column name is completely absent, the numbered suffix we add becomes the entire name. Originally, we chose `..j` (two dots and a number), but that produces names that require special handling.
Names of the form `..j` have a special meaning: they are reserved words, you can assign them a value but not query them.


```r
..2 <- 5
..2
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): ..2 used in an incorrect context, no ... to look in
```


The ability to query a value by name is very important in the tidy evaluation framework:


```r
df <- tibble(`..1` = "not ok")
with(df, `..1`)
#> Error in eval(substitute(expr), data, enclos = parent.frame()): ..1 used in an incorrect context, no ... to look in
dplyr::select(df, `..1`)
#> Error in .f(.x[[i]], ...): ..1 used in an incorrect context, no ... to look in
```

Since name repair is often something that happens automatically, we think it's best to suffix with `...j` (three dots and a number) and leave people with names that are easier to work with.


```r
names(as_tibble(list(1, 2, 3), .name_repair = "unique"))
#> New names:
#> * `` -> ...1
#> * `` -> ...2
#> * `` -> ...3
#> [1] "...1" "...2" "...3"
```

For consistency, three dots are used for all disambiguating suffixes, not only for empty names.
This might affect you if you use *readxl* or another package that uses the new name repair, and we're sorry for the disruption.
We're confident that a bit of short-term pain now is better than the agony that would have come from the existent behavior.
Also, name repair currently is in the "maturing" lifecycle,
