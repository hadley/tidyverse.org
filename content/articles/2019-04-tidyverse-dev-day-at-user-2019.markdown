Our first [tidyverse developer day](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/11/tidyverse-developer-day-2019/), held after rstudio::conf(2019), was a great success. We're excited to announce that we'll be holding another one -- this time the day before the start of useR! 2019 in Toulouse, France (__Sunday, July 8th__).

 * 📆 **When:** 8 July, 9 am - 4 pm.  
 * 📍 **Where:** The same location as useR!, [the congress centre "Pierre Baudis"](https://www.centre-congres-toulouse.fr/fr).
 * 👥 **Who:** Anyone who would like to get better at contributing to the tidyverse! Everyone is welcome regardless of whether you've never done a PR before, or if you've already made your 10th package.
 * 💻 **What:** A day of learning and coding. We'll provide
breakfast, lunch, snacks, and coffee; you'll bring your laptop and enthusiasm.
The tidyverse team will be on hand to help out and answer your questions.
