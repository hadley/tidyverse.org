  This two-day course will provide an overview of using R for 
  supervised learning. The session will step through the process of building,
  visualizing, testing, and comparing models that are focused on prediction.
  The goal of the course is to provide a thorough workflow in R that can be
  used with many different regression or classification techniques.
  Case studies on real data will be used to illustrate the functionality and
  several different predictive models are illustrated. This class is taught
  by Max Kuhn.
